# Machine Learning and Optimization course: Gene Finding with Structure Prediction models

Gene finding is a crucial step in understanding the genome of a species once it has been sequenced. Recently, the growth of protein databases, combined with machine learning approaches, have made it possible to predict whether a DNA region is a gene or not. The strong character of explicit and implicit dependencies between the components in DNA sequences, is a fertile ground for structural prediction.

Our goal was to identify regions of genomics DNA that encode genes.

In this project, we implemented three types of models to achieve this goal and to predict the DNA sequences in two levels:

1. High level: Entire sequence - contain a gene or not.

2. Low level: Base - belongs to a gene or not.

The model types we implemented are:

1. Structure prediction model with no features.

2. Structure prediction model with features.

3. Independent prediction with no structure, with features.
